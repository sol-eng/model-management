The projects in this example demonstrate a full model lifecycle for different
versions of a model that were developed in RStudio Server Pro and deployed to
RStudio Connect.

The full example is documented at

The data set used in this example involves demographic information and payment
history of various customers and whether they defaulted/missed a payment on
their credit accounts.

RStudio Server Pro can be used with machine learning packages to develop, train,
and score models during development. RStudio Connect can be used to deploy
models and API routers as REST APIs and host published notebooks with details on
model training.
