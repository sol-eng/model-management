# Model Management in RStudio

## Overview

These example projects demonstrate a full model lifecycle for different versions
of a model that were developed in [RStudio Server
Pro](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-server-pro/) and deployed to
[RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/).

## Analysis

The data set used in this example involves demographic information and payment
history of various customers and whether they defaulted/missed a payment on
their credit accounts.

The example projects include model training notebooks, REST APIs serving
predictions, REST API traffic router, and a Shiny app to verify API results.

## RStudio Professional Products

RStudio Server Pro can be used with machine learning packages to develop, train,
and score models during development. RStudio Connect can be used to deploy
models and API routers as REST APIs and host published notebooks with details on
model training.
